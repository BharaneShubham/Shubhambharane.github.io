JDK (Java Development Kit) 
------------------------------
 - JDK = JRE + JVM
 - JDK provides environment to develop and run java application
 - JDK contains tools required to write Java programs, and JRE to execute them.
 - It includes a compiler, Java application launcher, Appletviewer, etc.
 - Compiler converts code written in Java into byte code.
 - Java application launcher opens a JRE, loads the necessary class, and executes its main method.

 
  JRE( Java Runtime Environment)
-------------------------------------
 - JRE = JVM + Library classes
 - just to run java application we required JRE.(Client machine)
 - JRE contains class libraries, JVM, and other supporting files. It does not contain any tool for 
     Java development like a debugger, compiler, etc.
 - It uses important package classes like math, swingetc, util, lang, awt, and runtime libraries.
 - If you have to run Java applets, then JRE must be installed in your system.


   JVM( Java Virtual machine)
--------------------------------

- JVM is Responsible to run our java programme line by line

 - JVM provides a platform-independent way of executing Java source code.
 - It has numerous libraries, tools, and frameworks.
 - Once you run Java program, you can run on any platform and save lots of time.
 - JVM comes with JIT(Just-in-Time) compiler that converts Java source code into low-level machine language. 
    Hence, it runs more faster as a regular application.


   How To Compile and Run Java code?
----------------------------------------
 - javac ClassName.java to compile our code
 - java ClassName to run our code


java Test
1. Start JVM. 
2. Create and start Main Thread by JVM.
3. Locate(find) Test.class by main Thread.                                   
4. Load Test.class by main Thread. // static variable creation 
5. Execution of main() method.
6. Unload Test.class // static variable destruction
7. Terminate main Thread.
8. Shutdown JVM
